# PWYW
PWYW or Pay What You Want is a series of projects that I will be working on in order to gain general experience. Clients may pay whatever they like for whatever the project is, as either way I take something from it (i.e experience). 

##This Project
The mission is to create a website for the "Digitalcoin Foundation". Due to the delay I've decieded to go with Bootstrap as the framework of this website to speed up developement. The website's background image before you scroll was based on an image found online but I couldn't track it down to a single person to credit. It was then heavily edited in GIMP so it would work better with the way I designed the website, which was fun (not). Although a lot of code here is pre-existing, I've had to heavily edit it all as well as my own snippets of JQuery, CSS and of course HTML. 

##Preview
See a live preview of the site in it's current development state [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BurnBabyBurn71/PWYW_Digitalcoin_Foundation/blob/master/index.html)
